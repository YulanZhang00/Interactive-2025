        Doraemon was born on September 3, 2112 at the Matsushiba factory in Tokyo, 
        Japan, and was number 1 after number 0 on the mass production line on that day.
        During the manufacturing process, an accident occurred and one of the screws was removed,
        making him a “special” robot. He is sent to a special class at the Robot School, 
        where he meets the “Doraemon Seven” and becomes friends with them. Afterwards,
        Doraemon attends a robot sales event at the Robotics School, where Seaworthy,
        who was just a toddler at the time, accidentally pushes the buy button and buys Doraemon. 
        Doraemon works at Seishu's house as a childcare robot. In order to change the future of Nobita, 
        the worst ancestor of Sewash, Sesshu decides to ask Doraemon to return to the 20th/21st century to help Nobita.
